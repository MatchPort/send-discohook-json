## Instructions for Setting up the Embed

1. Navigate to [Discohook](https://discohook.org/) to start the process.

2. Clear all existing data by clicking on the two 'X' icons and deleting any text in the content box. This step prepares the environment for your new embed.

3. Design your new embed according to your requirements.

4. Upon completion, scroll down the page until you find the 'JSON Data Editor'. Click to open it.

5. Copy the data by clicking 'Copy to Clipboard'.

6. Now, download the script file and open it using a text editor such as Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

7. Locate the line of code that says `Data`.

8. Remove the existing data within this section and paste the data you copied from Discohook.

9. Find the line of code that contains `webhook = 'here'`.

10. Replace `'here'` with your actual webhook. This step connects your data to the correct webhook.
